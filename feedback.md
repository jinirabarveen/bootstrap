## Date 6th May

# Folder structure is not correct - you should have put all bootstrap files - which are not being used - where is the second page. Put everything in either CSS, JS or fonts folders.
# Couldn't find any semantic elements
# Containers are not fluid 
- therefore most grid cells are coming as is - which is not responsive
# Carousel images must take the entire space
# Media queries should be written for changing images as 
well
# During Emulator view - you navigation menu is going out
 of place - taking too much space  - 
 you coud have also used glypicons -
 just found that in right and left navigation of Carousel.
# Not Happy the layout - could find other bootstrap 
components such as TABS or Map Widget or Modal - 
You can do better
